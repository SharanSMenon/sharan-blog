Hello Guys! Welcome to my blog! My name is Sharan Sajiv Menon and I like to develop. I will be posting articles on this regularly and this blog will change a lot over the course of the next few months. Some posts might be deleted as I am constantly testing out new features here and there. 

Here are some topics I might post about

1. Tech
2. Development - Like frontend and backend 
3. Programming
4. Tips and Tricks
5. Top 10's
6. And more...

There will be more content to come in the next few months (and years) so stay tuned.
Bye for now!

Sharan
