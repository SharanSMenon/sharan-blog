Hello guys and welcome back to my blog (or welcome to my blog if this is your first visit here). I will be sharing my thoughts on the new 16 inch MacBook pro that Apple dropped a few days ago. The computer is a really cool laptop. It can have up to 64 gigs of RAM and 8 TB of storage.

## Tech Specs

Here are some

1. CPU - 9th gen Intel Core i9 - Turbo boost up to 5.0 ghz
2. Storage - Up to 8 TB
3. RAM - Up to 64 GB
4. Operating System - MacOS
5. Graphics Card - AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory

These are some beastly tech specs. 64 GB of ram and 8 TB of storage is a lot of storage. My current computer only has 256 GB of storage and 8 GB and I am doing great with it (Its a 2015 13 inch MBP). The CPU is great and the Graphics should be good for Pros. I don't remember gamers wanting to play on macs. This computer is really meant for pros, not gamers or casual people. 

For a casual person who just wants a 16 inch MBP, the base model should be more than enough (which starts at $2399, same as the old 15 inch MBP). The base model should last you around 5 years before the tech in it gets outdated. I am currently using a MBP from 2015 which is in working condition. 

## MacOS

MacOS has always been great. MacOS has many advantages over Windows 10. It isn't as buggy as windows (when I used to use windows, it was a really buggy experience). MacOS looks a lot cleaner and it is a lot cleaner. Back in windows, I had no idea where my applications were stored, the only way to delete applications was from the start menu, which is really inefficient because some applications don't even get deleted. Also, updates for MacOS are a lot smoother than updates for Windows. Sometimes, you don't even know that your Mac updated. 

Anyways, I will save the MacOS vs Windows comparison for a different post where I will list pros to both Windows and Mac, and go into it in a lot more detail.

## Conclusion

I believe that this computer is for professionals who do things like video editing, coding, and other types of work. This computer is too overpowered for the casual user and gamers are probably not going to get an enjoyable experience on the MBP.

Ok. Thanks for reading this post and I will see you later1

Bye!!!
