Hello and welcome to my blog. In this post, we will be outlining the differences between Angular and AngularJS and what you should learn if you want to learn either of those technologies.

Let's get started! We will first give a brief comparison between them and then dive deeper into the features of each.

## Angular vs AngularJS brief outline

AngularJS was released in 2009. Angular is the name given to version 2 and above. In 2016, AngularJS got a big rewrite and was released as Angular 2, which is now known as Angular. AngularJS is version 1. That can be a bit confusing and I would recommend you learn Angular. AngularJS is old and steadily declining in popularity, while Angular is new and has very new technologies and is also rising in popularity. If you want a styling solution to style your angular or angularjs app, both frameworks offer an official material design library optimized for that framework (Angular Material and AngularJS Material)

## Features of Angular

1. Angular uses Typescript
2. Angular is component based
3. Angular projects are modular
4. They can be organized
5. Most angular projects are made with the Angular CLI
6. Angular has its own routing solution
7. Was released in 2016 and is newer, so it uses more modern and secure technologies

## Features of AngularJS
1. It uses Javascript
2. It can be added to any `.html` file
3. It is component based
4. It also has its own routing solution
5. You can use the angular seed repository 
6. It is older - not really a feature
7. Easier to learn than Angular

## Conclusion
This is a short post outlining the differences between Angular and AngularJS. You can see that Angular is a better option for building apps and this is especially true when building large apps with teams. Angular's modularity and organization really helps it to stand out. I would recommend that you learn Angular even though it is harder to learn than AngularJS.

All right. That's it for this post and I will see you next time. Until then, Bye!!
