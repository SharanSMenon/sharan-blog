This tutorial will teach about two methods that can be used to solve quadratic equations. The methods covered will include:

1. Factoring
2. Quadratic formula

These methods are really powerful and can help you a lot of you are ever trying to solve quadratic equations. Let's get started!

## Factoring

The first method that we will cover today is the factoring method. This involves factoring the equation into multiple parts, typically 2. Let's take the following equation and try to find $x$:

$$
y=x^2+5x+6
$$

We can factor this equation easily. We have to see which 2 numbers add up to $b$ and which 2 numbers multiply to $c$. So $m+n=b$ and $mn=c$. The two numbers that fit this scenario are 3 and 2. That means that we can factor our equation into this form:

$$
y=(x+3)(x+2)
$$

Now, if we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$, we get -3, and -2.

> This shows that you have to be very careful. Just because we got 3 and 2 above, doesn't mean that this is our final answer.

This is how factoring works and as you can see, factoring is a very powerful tool for solving quadratic equations.

## Quadratic Formula

The second method we will be talking about today is the quadratic formula. This is by far the most effective formula to solve quadratic equations. It can solve any equation and for complex equations (any equation that has a solution), it is easier to use than factoring and completing the square.

Here is the formula down below:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

Remember that a quadratic equation is in the form:

$$
f(x)=ax^2
+bx+c
$$

So we can use this formula to solve any quadratic formula. Let's try to solve this equation

$$
y=3x^2+4x
$$
In this equation, $a=3$, $b=4$, and $c=0$ since there is no $c$. Let's plug these numbers into the quadratic formula and see what we get.

$$
x=\frac{-(4)\pm \sqrt{4^2-4*3*0}}{2*3}
$$

This calculation gives two results:

$$
x=0, -\frac{4}{3}
$$

So there we go, we used the quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation that would have been difficult to do with factoring or completing the square.

> _Note_: in the quadratic formula, the part of the equation that says $b^2-4ac$ is called the discriminant and it will be useful itself in determining the number of solutions a quadratic equation has and other things. If the discriminant was negative, then the quadratic equation would have no solutions.

## Conclusion

Today, you learned about two methods to solve equations. You can use both methods somewhere in your life if you are ever trying to solve quadratic equations. In fact, for the quadratic formula, you can write a simple script where you plug in a, b, and c and it outputs the answers. 

Quadratic equations have applications everywhere and will be important as you enter higher mathematics like calculus and other areas.

That's it for this tutorial and I will see you next time.
